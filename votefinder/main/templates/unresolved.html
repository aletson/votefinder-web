<h1>Unresolved Votes</h1>

<p>Sorry, VoteFinder can't create a good votecount right now because there are some votes it doesn't understand.  Please
	resolve the ones listed below by deciding who the author intended to vote.</p>

<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" border="0" id="unresolved">
{% for v in votes %}
	<tr>
		<td>{{v.author}} votes {{v.targetString}}</td> 
		<td><select class="resolver" id="{{v.id}}">
			<option value="-1">Ignore</option>
			<option value="-2">No Lynch</option>
			<option value="0" selected="selected">------</option>
			{% for p in players %}
				<option value="{{p.player.id}}">{{p.player.name|safe}}</option>
			{% endfor %}
		</select></td>
	</tr>
{% endfor %}
